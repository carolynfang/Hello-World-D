# Hello-World-D
My first every project or repo on Github

How to use

First of all, go to github.com. Then, create an account with your email address. After that, you can make another account for GitHub to send you emails, or you can just use your primary email. Once you've made sure everything is the way you want, create your account. There you go!

How to contribute

You can create repositories like this one. Once you've created a respository, you might want to change it. If you want to change it, go down to the "Commit Change" section below the repository, and something with "Update <repo name>" will show up, You can also add an optional description to the change. There's also an option for either a "master" branch or your own. For a tutorial, it's better to use your own and then create a pull request. Once everything is done, click the "Commit Changes" button, and there you go! You just asked for a pull request. It's also possible to talk to others in the community with GitHub. You can ask someone to help with your project, or just talk to them online.
