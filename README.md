# Hello-World-D
My first every project or repo on Github

How to use (Heading 1)

First of all, create an account. Use your Google account to log in if you're doing the Google Code-in contest like I am. Then, make sure everything is what you want, and then sign up. Once it's created, click the '+' icon next to your profile pic, and start creating a respository. There's also options for a gist, an organization, and importorting a repository.

How to contribute (Heading 2)

You can create repositories like this one. Once you've created a respository, you might want to change it. If you want to change it, go down to the "Commit Change" section below the repository, and something with "Update <repo name>" will show up, You can also add an optional description to the change. There's also an option for either a "master" branch or your own. For a tutorial, it's better to use your own and then create a pull request. Once everything is done, click the "Commit Changes" button, and there you go! You just asked for a pull request. It's also possible to talk to others in the community with GitHub. You can ask someone to help with your project, or just talk to them online.
